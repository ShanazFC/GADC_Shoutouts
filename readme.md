# Hi!

This is a fork-n-go project modeled after jlord's tool lending library and modified to incorporate info from our shoutouts database.

It was an experiment for how easy it is to pull data from a spreadsheet and display it dynamically on a page.

## Read more about how this is done here. 

A website and spreadsheet set up to make lending tools to friends or neighbors easier. Fork this project, create a spreadsheet and you've got your own site live. **[Fork-n-go!](http://jlord.github.io/forkngo)**
